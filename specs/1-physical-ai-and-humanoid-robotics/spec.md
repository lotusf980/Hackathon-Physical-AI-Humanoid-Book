# Specification for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Project

## 1. Feature Description

This project will produce a technical, academic, and practical textbook for students of Computer Science, AI, and Robotics that explains how to build, simulate, and control humanoid robots using modern Physical AI techniques. The goal is to bridge the gap between digital intelligence (AI models) and physical intelligence (robotic bodies) by guiding learners through a complete pipeline: AI -> ROS 2 -> Simulation -> Perception -> Action -> Physical Deployment. The final output will be a Docusaurus-powered online book published via GitHub Pages, along with a PDF version containing embedded citations.

## 2. User Scenarios

*   A student uses the book to learn how to build a ROS 2 control network for a simulated humanoid.
*   A robotics hobbyist follows the book to simulate a humanoid robot operating in a realistic environment using Gazebo and Unity.
*   A developer uses the book to create an AI-powered perception + navigation system for humanoids with NVIDIA Isaac.
*   An educator uses the book to guide students in building a simulated humanoid robot that hears a voice command, understands it, plans a path, navigates obstacles, identifies an object, and interacts with the environment.

## 3. Functional Requirements

*   The book must provide a clear explanation of ROS 2 architecture, including nodes, topics, services, and actions.
*   The book must include code examples in rclpy with Python.
*   The book must explain how to use URDF for humanoid robots.
*   The book must explain how to create and run ROS 2 packages.
*   The book must explain how to set up Gazebo and build environments.
*   The book must explain physics concepts such as gravity, collision, and friction.
*   The book must explain how to simulate sensors such as LiDAR, IMU, and depth cameras.
*   The book must provide guidance on high-fidelity simulation with Unity.
*   The book must explain how to use NVIDIA Isaac Sim.
*   The book must explain how to generate synthetic data.
*   The book must explain VSLAM and navigation.
*   The book must explain reinforcement learning for robotics.
*   The book must explain the Sim-to-real pipeline.
*   The book must explain how to use Whisper for voice recognition.
*   The book must explain how to use LLMs for planning.
*   The book must explain multi-step reasoning for robotics.
