# ROS 2 Architecture

ROS 2 employs a distributed architecture where different software components communicate with each other through a middleware layer. The core concepts of ROS 2 architecture include:

*   **Nodes**: Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of a ROS 2 system. A node is an executable that performs a specific task. For example, a node might control a robot's motors, process sensor data, or perform path planning.

*   **Topics**: Topics are named buses over which nodes exchange messages. A node can publish messages to a topic, and other nodes can subscribe to that topic to receive the messages. This publish-subscribe pattern enables a flexible and decoupled communication system.

*   **Services**: Services provide a request-response communication mechanism. A node can provide a service, which other nodes can then call to request a specific action. Services are useful for tasks that require a synchronous interaction.

*   **Actions**: Actions are a more complex form of request-response communication that allows for long-running tasks with feedback and cancellation. An action consists of a goal, feedback, and result. Actions are useful for tasks such as navigating to a specific location or picking up an object.

## Communication Patterns

ROS 2 supports several communication patterns, including:

*   **Publish-Subscribe**: Nodes communicate by publishing messages to topics and subscribing to topics to receive messages.
*   **Request-Response**: Nodes communicate by making requests to services and receiving responses.
*   **Action-Goal-Feedback-Result**: Nodes communicate by sending goals to actions, receiving feedback during execution, and receiving a result upon completion.
