# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System - ROS 2

Welcome to the first module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook! In this module, we will explore the foundations of robotic middleware using ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2).

ROS 2 provides a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a variety of robotic platforms.

In this module, you will learn about:

*   ROS 2 architecture: Understand the core concepts of nodes, topics, services, and actions.
*   rclpy with Python: Write ROS 2 code using Python.
*   URDF for humanoid robots: Describe the physical structure of robots.
*   Launch files & parameters: Configure and launch ROS 2 applications.
*   Creating and running ROS 2 packages: Organize and build ROS 2 projects.

By the end of this module, you will be able to build a working ROS 2 control network for a simulated humanoid.
