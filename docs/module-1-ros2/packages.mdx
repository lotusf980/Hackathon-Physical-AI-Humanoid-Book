# Creating and Running ROS 2 Packages

In ROS 2, code is organized into packages. A package is a directory that contains a `package.xml` file, which describes the package, and a `CMakeLists.txt` file, which specifies how to build the package.

## Creating a Package

To create a ROS 2 package, you can use the `ros2 pkg create` command:

```bash
ros2 pkg create <package_name> --build-type ament_cmake --dependencies rclcpp rclpy std_msgs
```

This command will create a new directory with the specified package name and generate the necessary files.

## Building a Package

To build a ROS 2 package, you can use the `colcon build` command:

```bash
colcon build --packages-select <package_name>
```

This command will build the specified package and its dependencies.

## Running a Package

To run a ROS 2 package, you need to source the ROS 2 environment and then use the `ros2 run` command:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run <package_name> <executable_name>
```

This will execute the specified executable in the ROS 2 environment.
