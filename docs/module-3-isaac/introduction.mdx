# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain - NVIDIA Isaac

Welcome to the third module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook! In this module, we will explore the use of NVIDIA Isaac for AI perception and navigation in robotics.

NVIDIA Isaac is a robotics platform that provides a set of tools and libraries for developing and deploying AI-powered robots. It includes Isaac Sim, a photorealistic simulator, and Isaac ROS, a collection of hardware-accelerated ROS 2 packages.

In this module, you will learn about:

*   Isaac Sim: Explore the features of NVIDIA's photorealistic simulator for robotics.
*   Synthetic data generation: Generate training data for AI models using Isaac Sim.
*   Isaac ROS: Learn about the hardware-accelerated ROS 2 packages provided by NVIDIA.
*   VSLAM and navigation: Implement visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) and navigation algorithms.
*   Reinforcement learning for robotics: Train AI models for robotics using reinforcement learning.
*   Sim-to-real pipeline: Transfer AI models trained in simulation to real-world robots.

By the end of this module, you will be able to create an AI-powered perception + navigation system for humanoids using NVIDIA Isaac.
