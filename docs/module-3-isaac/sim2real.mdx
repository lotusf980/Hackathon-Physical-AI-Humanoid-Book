# The Sim-to-Real Pipeline

The sim-to-real pipeline refers to the process of transferring AI models trained in simulation to real-world robots. This is a crucial step in robotics development, as it allows you to leverage the benefits of simulation while still deploying your models on real robots.

## Challenges of Sim-to-Real

*   **Reality Gap**: The simulation environment is never a perfect replica of the real world. There will always be differences in lighting, textures, physics, and other factors.
*   **Sensor Noise**: Real-world sensors are subject to noise and errors that are not present in simulation.
*   **Actuator Limitations**: Real-world actuators have limitations in terms of speed, accuracy, and torque that are not always captured in simulation.

## Techniques for Sim-to-Real

*   **Domain Randomization**: Vary the simulation environment during training to make the model more robust to changes in the real world.
*   **System Identification**: Use real-world data to identify the parameters of the robot and environment, and then use these parameters to create a more accurate simulation.
*   **Adaptive Control**: Use control algorithms that can adapt to changes in the environment.
