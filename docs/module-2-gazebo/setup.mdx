# Setting up Gazebo and Building Environments

Gazebo is a popular open-source robot simulator that allows you to create realistic 3D environments and simulate the behavior of robots in those environments.

## Installation

To install Gazebo, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gazebo9
```

## Creating a World

A Gazebo world is a description of the environment in which the robot will be simulated. A world can contain models, lights, sensors, and other objects.

To create a world, you can create a SDF (Simulation Description Format) file. SDF is an XML format that describes the properties of a simulation environment.

## Adding Models

Models are the objects that populate the Gazebo world. Models can be robots, sensors, or other objects. Gazebo comes with a library of pre-built models that you can use in your simulations. You can also create your own models using SDF.

## Running Gazebo

To run Gazebo with your world, you can use the following command:

```bash
gazebo <world_file>
```
