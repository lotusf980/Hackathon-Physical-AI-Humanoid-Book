# Physics Concepts in Robotics Simulation

In robotics simulation, understanding fundamental physics concepts is crucial for creating realistic and accurate simulations. Here, we will explore gravity, collision, and friction.

## Gravity

Gravity is the force that attracts objects with mass towards each other. In Gazebo, gravity is typically set to -9.81 m/s² in the Z-axis, which corresponds to Earth's gravity. It is important to consider gravity when simulating robots, as it affects their stability and movement.

## Collision

Collision occurs when two or more objects come into contact with each other. In Gazebo, collision is handled by collision detection algorithms. These algorithms determine whether two objects are in contact and, if so, calculate the forces that are generated as a result of the collision.

## Friction

Friction is a force that opposes motion between two surfaces in contact. In Gazebo, friction is modeled using various friction models. The most common friction model is the Coulomb friction model, which is based on the concept of static and dynamic friction.

*   **Static Friction**: The force that prevents two surfaces from moving relative to each other when they are at rest.
*   **Dynamic Friction**: The force that opposes the motion of two surfaces that are moving relative to each other.
