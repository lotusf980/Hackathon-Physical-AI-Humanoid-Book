# Simulating Sensors in Gazebo

Robots rely on sensors to perceive their environment. In simulation, we can model different types of sensors to mimic real-world sensor data. Here, we will explore simulating LiDAR, IMU, and depth cameras in Gazebo.

## LiDAR

LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors emit laser beams and measure the time it takes for the beams to return, allowing them to create a 3D point cloud of the surrounding environment. In Gazebo, LiDAR sensors can be simulated using the `ray` sensor.

## IMU

IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors measure a robot's acceleration and angular velocity. In Gazebo, IMU sensors can be simulated using the `imu` sensor.

## Depth Camera

Depth cameras capture both color images and depth information, allowing robots to perceive the distance to objects in their environment. In Gazebo, depth cameras can be simulated using the `camera` sensor with the `depth` element enabled.

Each sensor offers unique information about the simulated environment.
