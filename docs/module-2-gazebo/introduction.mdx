# Module 2: The Digital Twin - Gazebo and Unity

Welcome to the second module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook! In this module, we will explore the world of robot simulation using Gazebo and Unity.

Simulation is a powerful tool for developing and testing robot software without the need for physical robots. It allows you to quickly iterate on your code and test it in a variety of environments.

In this module, you will learn about:

*   Gazebo setup and environment building: Create realistic simulation environments.
*   Physics: gravity, collision, friction: Understand the physics concepts that govern robot simulation.
*   SDF vs URDF: Learn about the different file formats used to describe robots in simulation.
*   Sensor simulation: LiDAR, IMU, Depth camera: Simulate the sensors used in real-world robots.
*   High-fidelity simulation with Unity: Create more realistic simulations using Unity.

By the end of this module, you will be able to simulate a humanoid robot operating in a realistic environment.
