# High-Fidelity Simulation with Unity

Unity is a powerful game engine that can also be used for high-fidelity robotics simulation. It provides a rich set of tools and features for creating realistic and interactive environments.

## Setting up Unity for Robotics

To use Unity for robotics simulation, you can use the Unity Robotics Hub, which provides a set of packages and tools for building robot simulations in Unity.

## Importing Robot Models

You can import robot models into Unity using various file formats, such as URDF or FBX. The Unity Robotics Hub provides tools for importing and converting robot models.

## Creating a Simulation Environment

Unity provides a variety of tools for creating realistic simulation environments. You can use the Unity Asset Store to find pre-built assets, or you can create your own assets using Unity's built-in tools.

## Interfacing with ROS 2

You can connect Unity to ROS 2 using the ROS TCP Connector package. This package allows you to exchange messages between Unity and ROS 2, enabling you to control your robot in simulation using ROS 2.
