# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action

Welcome to the fourth module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook! In this module, we will explore how to combine vision, language, and action to create robots that can understand and interact with the world in a more natural way.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) is an emerging field that focuses on building robots that can:

*   Understand natural language commands.
*   Perceive their environment through vision.
*   Plan and execute actions to achieve desired goals.

In this module, you will learn about:

*   Whisper voice recognition: Transcribe spoken language into text.
*   LLM planning ("Clean the room" -> actions): Use large language models to generate robot plans from natural language commands.
*   Multi-step reasoning for robotics: Enable robots to reason about complex tasks that require multiple steps.

By the end of this module, you will be able to build a simulated humanoid robot that: Hears a voice command, Understands it, Plans a path, Navigates obstacles, Identifies an object, Interacts with the environment.
