# LLM Planning for Robotics

Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to generate robot plans from natural language commands. This allows robots to perform complex tasks without the need for explicit programming.

## LLMs for Robotics Planning

1.  **Command Understanding**: The LLM parses natural language commands, extracting the user’s intent and required actions.
2.  **Action Decomposition**: Decomposes high-level commands into a sequence of simpler actions that the robot can execute.
3.  **Constraint Satisfaction**: Takes into account environmental constraints (obstacles, joint limits) to generate feasible plans.

## Example

User command: "Clean the room"

LLM Output:

1.  Locate all objects that are considered clutter (e.g., trash, misplaced items).
2.  Navigate to each object.
3.  Pick up the object.
4.  If the object is trash, navigate to the trash can and drop the object.
5.  If the object is misplaced, navigate to the correct location and place the object.
6.  Repeat steps 1-5 until all clutter has been addressed.
