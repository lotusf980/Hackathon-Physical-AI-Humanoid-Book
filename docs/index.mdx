# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Embodied Intelligence in the Real World

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This comprehensive guide covers the essential concepts and practical implementations for building, simulating, and deploying AI systems in physical humanoid robots using ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## Modules

Explore the different modules to learn about various aspects of humanoid robotics:

### [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System – ROS 2](./module-1-ros2/introduction)
Learn about ROS 2 architecture, nodes, topics, services, actions, and how to build a working ROS 2 control network for a simulated humanoid.

### [Module 2: The Digital Twin – Gazebo & Unity](./module-2-gazebo/introduction)
Discover how to set up Gazebo and build environments, understand physics concepts, simulate sensors, and create high-fidelity simulations with Unity.

### [Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain – NVIDIA Isaac](./module-3-isaac/introduction)
Explore Isaac Sim, synthetic data generation, Isaac ROS, VSLAM and navigation, reinforcement learning for robotics, and the Sim-to-real pipeline.

### [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](./module-4-vla/introduction)
Understand how to use Whisper for voice recognition, LLMs for planning, and multi-step reasoning for robotics.

## [Capstone Project](./capstone/guide)
Apply everything you've learned in a comprehensive project that integrates all concepts to build a simulated humanoid robot capable of hearing voice commands, understanding them, planning paths, navigating obstacles, identifying objects, and interacting with the environment.

This textbook bridges the gap between digital intelligence (AI models) and physical intelligence (robotic bodies) by guiding learners through a complete pipeline: AI → ROS 2 → Simulation → Perception → Action → Physical Deployment.
