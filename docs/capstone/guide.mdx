# Capstone: Humanoid Robot Simulation

This capstone project will guide you through building a complete simulation of a humanoid robot that integrates all the concepts learned in the previous modules. You will create a robot that can hear a voice command, understand it, plan a path, navigate obstacles, identify an object, and interact with the environment.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, ensure you have completed the following modules:

*   Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System - ROS 2
*   Module 2: The Digital Twin - Gazebo & Unity
*   Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain - NVIDIA Isaac
*   Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Project Overview

The capstone project involves the following components:

1.  **Robot Model**: Create a humanoid robot model using URDF.
2.  **Simulation Environment**: Create a Gazebo environment with obstacles and objects.
3.  **Voice Command Processing**: Use Whisper to process voice commands.
4.  **Command Understanding**: Use an LLM to interpret the voice command and generate a plan.
5.  **Navigation**: Implement VSLAM and navigation to move the robot through the environment.
6.  **Object Recognition**: Use Isaac Sim to recognize objects in the environment.
7.  **Action Execution**: Execute the plan generated by the LLM.

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Set up the environment**: Install and configure ROS 2, Gazebo, and Isaac Sim.
2.  **Create the robot model**: Define the robot's physical structure using URDF.
3.  **Create the simulation environment**: Design a Gazebo world with obstacles and objects.
4.  **Implement voice processing**: Integrate Whisper to transcribe voice commands.
5.  **Implement LLM planning**: Use an LLM to generate a sequence of actions based on the voice command.
6.  **Implement navigation**: Integrate VSLAM and navigation algorithms to move the robot.
7.  **Implement object recognition**: Use Isaac Sim to identify objects in the environment.
8.  **Implement action execution**: Execute the plan generated by the LLM.
9.  **Test and refine**: Test the simulation and refine the implementation as needed.

## Conclusion

This capstone project provides a comprehensive application of the concepts learned throughout the textbook. By completing this project, you will have built a simulated humanoid robot that demonstrates the integration of ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim, VSLAM, navigation, voice recognition, LLMs, and multi-step reasoning.
